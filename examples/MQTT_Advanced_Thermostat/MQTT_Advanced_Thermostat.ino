 *    MQTT_Advanced_Thermostat is a program to demonstrate a real working thermostat over MQTT.
 *    This thermostat publishes measured room temperature about the boiler to the MQTT broker in topic 'temperature'.
 *    It subscribes to topic 'room_temperature_setpoint' to receive the room temperature setpoint.

 *
 *    You need an OpenTherm controller that you can buy at my Tindie store, see <https://www.tindie.com/products/jeroen88/opentherm-controller/>
 *    Connect the two boiler wires to the OpenTherm controller pins marked OT. The order of the wires is not important.
 *    Connect the OpenTherm controller to your microcontroller's power (3v3) and ground (GND) pins.
 *    Connect the OpenTherm TXD pin to the microcontroller's pin defined by #define OT_RX_PIN.
 *    Connect the OpenTherm RXD pin to the microcontroller's pin defined by #define OT_TX_PIN.
 *
 *    Connect the BME280 temperature sensor SDA pin to the microcontroller's pin defined by #define I2C_SDA_PIN
 *    Connect the BME280 temperature sensor SCL pin to the microcontroller's pin defined by #define I2C_SCL_PIN
 *    Check your sensor's address, it may differ from the value defined by #define BME_ADDRESS (0x76)
 *    Install the Adafruit BME280 library
 *    Any other temperature sensor may be used, like a Dallas sensor, BME380, BMP380, BME680 if you adapt the program accordingly.
 *
 *    Set the room temperature setpoint (desired room temperature) using a MQTT client.
 *    Eventually define the maximum central heating boiler temperature setpoint using #define CH_MAX_SETPOINT. 
 *
 *    Compile and upload the program as normal. If the temperature measured by your sensor is lower than the ROOM_TEMPERATURE_SETPOINT this thermostat program
 *    will actually begin to heat up your room

/* IMPORTANT NOTICES
 * You have to do a lot of configuration to get this running! It is not difficult, but you have to be diligent.
 * This example uses a certificate to autenticate the MQTT server and to ecnrypt the connection using TLS (Transport Layer Security) with a WiFiClientSecure.
 * If you do not want to use this feature, because e.g. your MQTT broker does not support it, you have to adapt this program:
 * - Use a WiFiClient instead of a WiFiClientSecure
 * - Do not define const char CACertificate[] (remove it from the program or leave it 'as is')
 * - Do not call wiFiClient.setCACert(CACertificate);
 *
 * You SHOULD provide your #define TIME_ZONE, otherwise the time displayed will be different than your timezone. The value provided for in the example is
 * Central Europe Time with Daylight Saving
 *
 * You MUST provide the GPIO pins the OpenTherm controller is connected to (#define OT_RX_PIN and #define OT_TX_PIN)
 *
 * You MUST use a BME280 temperature sensor board and provide the I2C address of your sensor and the GPIO pins it is connected to (#define BME_ADDRESS,
 * #define I2C_SDA_PIN and I2C_SCL_PIN)
 * You MAY use a completely different sensor, e.g a BME680 or even a Dallas temperature sensor) but then you MUST  adapt the program accordingly
 * 
 * You MUST provide your WiFi credentials (const char * ssid and const char * password)
 *
 * You MUST provide your MQTT server, MQTT user name and MQTT password (const char * mqtt_server, const char * mqtt_user and 
 * const char * mqtt_password)
 *    This thermostat publishes the corrected measured room temperature to the MQTT broker in topic 'temperature'
 *    It subscribes to topic 'room_temperature_setpoint' to receive the room temperature setpoint. This temperature is not persistant. If you restart the
 *    program, you have to resend it.
 *
 * You MUST provide the CA certificate of your MQTT server (unless you use an insecure connection, see above, const char CACertificate[]) 
 *
 * You SHOULD calibrate your sensor by measuring a low temperature (e.g. 15 *C, not very critical) and a high temperature (e.g. 20 *C, again not critical) 
 * with both the temperature sensor and a calibrated thermomter. Store the results into #define LOWER_MEASURED_TEMPERATURE, LOWER_CALIBRATED_TEMPERATURE, 
 * HIGHER_MEASURED_TEMPERATURE and HIGHER_CALIBRATED_TEMPERATURE)
 *
 * You MAY want to change the minimum and maximum room temperature using #define ROOM_TEMPERATURE_MIN_SETPOINT and ROOM_TEMPERATURE_MAX_SETPOINT. On startup
 * the thermostat is set to ROOM_TEMPERATURE_MIN_SETPOINT. In this example these values are set to 12.0 and 25.0 *C
 *
 * You MAY want to change the minimum and maximum Central Heating boiler water temperatures using #define CH_MIN_SETPOINT and #define CH_MAX_SETPOINT. In
 *    this example these values are set to 10.0 and 60.0 *C. Remember: lowering the maximum will reduce the power of your central heating, thus increasing 
 *    the time to heaten up your room and lowering the gas usage per hour. A good practise seems to lower this temperature for a well insulated house and/or
 *    using low temperature radiators e.g to 40.0 *C. If it takes too long to warm your house on a very cold winter day, increase to 60.0 *C or even higher
 *    in a badly insulated house. Check your boiler manual for the right maximum temperature.
 *
 * I hope you enjoy working with this library, pPlease share ideas in the Github Discussions sessions of this library.
