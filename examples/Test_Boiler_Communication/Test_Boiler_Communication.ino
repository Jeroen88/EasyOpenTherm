 *    You need an OpenTherm controller that you can buy at my Tindie store,
 *    Connect the two boiler wires to the OpenTherm controller pins marked OT. The order is not important.
 *    Connect the OpenTherm controller to your microcontroller's power (3v3) and ground (GND) pins.
 *    Connect the OpenTherm TXD pin to the microcontroller's pin defined by #define OT_RX_PIN.
 *    Connect the OpenTherm RXD pin to the microcontroller's pin defined by #define OT_TX_PIN.
